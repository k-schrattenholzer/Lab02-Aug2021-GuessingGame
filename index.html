                Keep it to yourself, but there's a real-life wizard behind this webpage and they want nothing more than to play a guessing game with you. <br>
                All you need to do is guess a whole number between 1 and 20 (including 1 and 20), input it into the field, and when you're ready, click Guess!
                Our wizard has determined you have 4 guesses to guess their favorite number.
            </p>
            <input id='user-guess' placeholder="your guess goes here" type="number"> 
            <button id='guess-button'>I'm ready to show the wizard my guess</button>
            <div id="results">               
                Your result will display here.
            </div>
            <div>
                Okay, hotshot, you've got
                <span id='guess-rem'></span> guesses left til the Wizard gets sick of it.
